# Who's That Pokemon?
This repository hosts a simple jQuery-based 'Who's That Pokemon?' Game. 'Who's That Pokemon?' is a regular feature of Pokemon television episodes; a Pokemon's silhouette is shown and the viewer is given a chance to guess which Pokemon's silhouette is being shown before the Pokemon is revealed.

To implement a simple version of the segment, I made the questions multiple-choice. Ten individually-timed questions are asked per round, at the end of which a score is displayed. Mostly as a proof of concept, Pokemon names and IDs are retrieved by calling the Pokeapi, rather than being stored locally.

The game can be played on Heroku at https://arcane-coast-88977.herokuapp.com/. If you prefer, you can instead clone the repository and open index.html in a web browser.
